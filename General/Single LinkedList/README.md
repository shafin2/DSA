Singly Linked List Implementation in Java
This is a Java program that implements a singly linked list, a common data structure used in computer science. The program allows for the addition, deletion, and updating of nodes in the linked list, as well as searching and printing the contents of the list.

Functions
The following functions are implemented in the program:

addAtFirst(String str): Adds a new node with the specified data at the beginning of the linked list.
addAtLast(String str): Adds a new node with the specified data at the end of the linked list.
addAtLoc(String str, int index): Adds a new node with the specified data at the specified index in the linked list.
deleteAtFirst(): Removes the first node from the linked list.
deleteAtLast(): Removes the last node from the linked list.
deleteAtLoc(int index): Removes the node at the specified index from the linked list.
deleteByData(String data): Removes all nodes from the linked list that contain the specified data.
search(String str): Searches the linked list for a node that contains the specified data and returns the node.
getSize(): Returns the number of nodes in the linked list.
print(): Prints the contents of the linked list to the console.
